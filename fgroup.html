<h3 class="method2">When to use:</h3>
<p>When outcomes of research are very unpredictable, and the researcher is looking for more open feedback.</p>

<h3 class="method2">How to use:</h3>
<p><b>1.</b>  Set goals and write the script;<br>
<b>2.</b>  Keep the discussion without inhibiting the flow of ideas and comments, ensuring that all group members contribute;<br>
<b>3.</b>  Write a short report summing up the prevailing mood in the group;<br>
<b>4.</b>  If possible, do more detailed analyses, such as affinity diagrams;<br>
<b>5.</b>  For the set-up are needed: participants, a table with name cards and unobtrusive microphone and camera. Sometimes it's useful to have a side room with flatscreens or a one-way mirror for observers and stakeholders.</p>

<h3 class="method2">Advantages:</h3>
<p><b>-</b> Helps getting in touch with users;<br>
<b>-</b> Let’s you discover what users’ thoughts, preferences and needs are;<br>
<b>-</b> Topics and discussion are more free-flowing, and members can use comments from others to stimulate recall.</p>

<h3 class="method2">Disadvantages:</h3>
<p><b>-</b> Depending on the environment, participants might not feel comfortable to share their honest opinion and experiences;<br>
<b>-</b> One person might take the lead and "bias" everyone;<br>
<b>-</b> Requires several representative users (min. 6) and more than one focus group, so the session is representative;<br>
<b>-</b> All information is self-reported (which can lead to inconveniences such as bias, variance and lack of memory), so it’s useful to combine it with other methods.</p>
