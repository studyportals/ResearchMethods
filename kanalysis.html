<h3 class="method2">When to use:</h3> 
<p>When needed to measure users’ satisfaction on the product attributes/features.</p>

<h3 class="method2">How to use:</h3>
<p><b>1.</b>  For each feature you want to evaluate, write two questions about it:</p>
  <p class="subtype"><b>&#8226;</b> If you had (feature), how would you feel?<br>
  <b>&#8226;</b>  If you didn’t have (feature), how would you feel?</p>

<p><b>2.</b>  For both questions, customers have to select one of the following responses: </p>
<p class="subtype"><b>&#8226;</b>  I like it;<br>
<b>&#8226;</b>  I expect it;<br>
<b>&#8226;</b>  I’m neutral;<br>
<b>&#8226;</b>  I can tolerate it;<br>
<b>&#8226;</b>  I dislike it.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> Sometimes is useful to ask a third question:</p>
<p class="subtype"><b>&#8226;</b> How important is this feature?<br>
<p>To answer this question, a seven to nine point Likert scale of “Not at all important” to “Extremely important” can be used;</p> 


<p><b>4.</b> After getting questionnaires from around 30 to 40 people, adding qualitative interviews helps to give the data that is missing context. Interviewing 5 to 15 of the previous participants should be enough;</p>

<p><b>5.</b>  Once you have responses for each question, cross-reference the question-pair to determine which Kano product attribute category (required, desired, delight, neutral or anti-feature) each feature maps to. Repeat this process for each question pair;</p> 

<p><b>6.</b>  Each product attribute can then be plotted into a Kano category (see point 5). Where it falls on the matrix can help you decide whether the product attribute will ultimately delight or disappoint the user.</p>

 <h3 class="method2">Advantages:</h3> 
<p><b>-</b> It is great for testing new ideas and discover expectations;<br>
<b>-</b> Identifies user’s needs and desires.</p>

<h3 class="method2">Disadvantages:</h3> 
<p><b>-</b> Sometimes people don’t know what they want until you show it to them;<br>
<b>-</b> When participants assess the real outcomes of the proposed features, the answers are prone to cognitive biases (a result of holding onto one's preferences and beliefs regardless of contrary information).</p>
