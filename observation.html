<h3 class="method">Semi-structured or casual</h3>
<p>Typically describes ethnographic methods in the exploratory phase of the design process.</p> 

<h3 class="method">Structured or systematic</h3>
<p>It's formalised by previous pre-structured time intervals, (using for instance worksheets and checklists). Ideal where environmental or behavioural elements are targeted and well defined.</p>

<p><hr style="color: #87B7CB;" /></p>

<h3 class="method2">When to use:</h3> 
<p>When wanting to know “what” users do in a specific situation.</p>

<h3 class="method2">How to use:</h3>
<p><b>1.</b>  First of all, the researcher(s) should know what s(he) wants to observe and have a guiding set of questions (but also keep in mind that unexpected events might occur during the observation);</p> 

<p><b>2.</b>  Observations can be done by observer(s), normally when participants don’t know they are being observed (“Fly-on-the-wall”) at the place where the phenomena that needs to be researched takes place, through immersion.<br> They can also be done without the presence of observers, placing cameras at the spot and analysing the content afterwards;</p>

<p><b>3.</b>  Despite their informal structure, semi-structured or casual observations should be well documented (with notes, sketches, photographs and/or videos).<br> Structured or systematic observation uses worksheets, checklists or other forms for codifying behaviours or observed artefacts and events.</p>

<h3 class="method2">Advantages:</h3> 
<p><b>-</b> It gives the researchers actual information of what users do.</p> 

<h3 class="method2">Disadvantages:</h3> 
<p><b>-</b> Can lead to ethical dilemmas;<br>
<b>-</b> Can be time consuming.</p>
