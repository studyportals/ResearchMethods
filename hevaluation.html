<h3 class="method2">When to use:</h3> 
<p>When wanting to inspect an interface and detect the baseline usability problems that should be fixed before user testing begins.<br> It's also useful to test the design principles and directions with experts, to support/test our design choices. At Studyportals we do design critic sessions (around once a month) to asses our products.</p> 

<h3 class="method2">How to use:</h3>
<p><b>1.</b>  Ask three to five UX-designers trained on the heuristics, to individually assess a product by walking through a core set of tasks and noting the places where the heuristics are not met in the product;<br> 
<b>2.</b>  Ask the evaluators to combine their findings together in a single report of issues that should be addressed.</p> 

<h3 class="method2">Advantages:</h3> 
<p><b>-</b> Provides quick and relatively inexpensive feedback early in the design process;<br> 
<b>-</b> Gives suggestions to designers on the best corrective measures;<br>
<b>-</b> The report also includes the positive findings, so people stay motivated;<br>
<b>-</b> There are platforms that facilitate the finding of experts and do the heuristic evaluation online (although this can also be expensive).</p>

<h3 class="method2">Disadvantages:</h3>  
<p><b>-</b> Multiple UX designers with knowledge and experience with the heuristics are needed (around 5) to combine their results, which can be expensive;<br>
<b>-</b> More minor issues and fewer major issues are usually identified.</p> 

<h3 class="method2">The 4 main design principles at Studyportals:</h3>

<p class="subtype"><b>1.</b>  Empathy:<br>
<b>-</b> Understand user needs and know business objectives;<br>
<b>-</b> Empathise with our users;<br>
<b>-</b> Collaborate with your peers.<br>
<b>2.</b> Clarity & Efficiency:<br>
<b>-</b> Focus on the relationships between items;<br>
<b>-</b> Create transparency;<br>
<b>-</b> Avoid unnecessary friction;<br>
<b>-</b> The experience is universal.<br>
<b>3.</b>  Consistency:<br>
<b>-</b> Aim for consistent interfaces;<br>
<b>-</b> Look for similarity in wording;<br>
<b>-</b> Value the brand identity.<br>
<b>4.</b>  Beauty:<br>
<b>-</b> There is never a second chance for a first impression;<br>
<b>-</b> Honour the details;<br>
<b>-</b> Delight our users.<p>

<p>We have some rules of thumb setup by the DOT team for design direction: <img src="images/dot.png" class="dot"/></p>
