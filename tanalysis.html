<h3 class="method">Hierarchical task analysis:</h3> 
<p>A structured, objective approach to describing users’ performance of tasks.<br> 
Provides an understanding of what tasks do users need to perform to achieve certain goals. The tasks can be divided in subtasks. As its name suggests, is basically focused on putting the actions that constitute a task into a hierarchy.<br> 
For example, in Studyportals, when we do usability tests, we normally have 3 main features to be tested and we decompose them into multiple task-scenarios (subtasks).</p>

<h3 class="method">Cognitive task analysis:</h3> 
<p>Aimed at understanding how users think while performing tasks that require a lot of cognitive activity, such as decision-making, problem-solving, memory, attention and judgement.<br> Some of the steps of a cognitive task analysis are: the mapping of the task, identifying the critical decision points, clustering, linking, prioritizing them, and characterizing.<br> 
For example, cognitive task analysis might be used to uncover how a novice performs compared to an expert or how experts make decisions, etc.</p>

<h3 class="method2">When to use:</h3> 
<p>Mainly when wanting to know which step in a work flow is the most complicated for users.</p>
<p>At Studyportals, we tried to use it to measure the performance of the tasks in a usability test, to quantify the qualitative results.
It can also be used for example using the HEART system: Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention and Task success. </p>
<p>It can also be useful to track the UX Key Performance Indicators.<br> The UX KPIs can be quantitative: Task success rate, Time on task, Use of search vs. navigation, User error rate and System Usability Scale, or qualitative: Reported expectations and performance; and Overall satisfaction.</p>

<h3 class="method2">How to use:</h3>
<p><b>1.</b>  Identify the task to be analysed;<br>
<b>2.</b>  Break this high-level task down into 4 to 8 subtasks. The subtask should be specified in terms of objectives and, between them, should cover the whole area of interest;<br>
<b>3.</b>  Draw a layered task diagram of each subtasks ensuring that it is complete;<br>
<b>4.</b>  Produce a written account as well as the decomposition diagram;<br>
<b>5.</b>  Present the analysis to someone who has not been involved in the decomposition but who knows the tasks well enough to evaluate consistency;<br>
<b>6.</b>  It’s important to note that you need to decide to what level of detail you are going to decompose subtasks so that you can ensure consistency across the board.</p>

<h3 class="method2">Advantages:</h3> 
<p><b>-</b> Easy to identify the main issues in a work flow.</p>

<h3 class="method2">Disadvantages:</h3> 
<p><b>-</b> User recruitment is needed;<br>
<b>-</b> Can be time-consuming.</p>
